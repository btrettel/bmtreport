Our paper relies on Sauvageot's work ([Sau97]) in an essential way. Although his paper is correct and beautifully written in our opinion, it seems to contain a handful of minor errors, which we think would be helpful to list here. We are fully responsible for any possible misinterpretation of part of his work or introduction of new errors. # <https://math.berkeley.edu/~swshin/Plancherel.pdf>
This paper is well-written, interesting, and engaging. This is one of those papers where I was left wanting more! I wish I could know who wrote this piece because I would relish the opportunity to sit with them, have a cup of coffee, and chat about the data presented in this piece and what was left on the cutting room floor. I think this piece is a great fit for this journal and readers of the journal are likely to appreciate the quality of this piece. # <https://twitter.com/jacasiegel/status/1453067404452392962/photo/1>
This paper is also exceptionally well written, with somewhat complex methods explained with admirable clarity. Highly unusual, I have no minor comments or suggestions for improvement. I recommend publication as is. # <https://twitter.com/elvisha9/status/1362503096463720450>
Well written. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/147047347376/well-written>
The authors are to be congratulated for developing a truly simple analysis for diffuser separation prediction. Perhaps the greatest achievement is merely to show that it can be done, whereas workers in the field have apparently agreed almost unanimously that diffusers cannot be analyzed by ordinary boundary layer theory. In this respect the authors are rather like bumblebees, who fly effortlessly in spite of the fact that standard aerodynamic theory forbids them to do so. Thus I applaud their achievement without reservation; but as long as a critical discussion is called for, I would venture to criticize some of the details. # white_discussion_1977
Please join me in congratulating Dr. Shady Emad Ahmed successfully defending his dissertation today, and onward to joining a fantastic group at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow. It has been great privilege to be your advisor. We will be watching you thrive and achieve many great things. Congrats Shady!!! # <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/omer-san-62585897_postdoctoral-digitaltwin-machinelearning-activity-6943384908165787648-J3sM>
Definitely this is a great course. I participated in it many years ago (probably edition 20+) taught by the distinguished professors of that time who initiated this course, Hewitt, Yadigaroglu, Hetsroni, and others. And I am sure that the quality and prestige are preserved. # <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexliberzon_short-courses-on-multiphase-flows-activity-6946351881732386816-RQ4Y>

Many congratulations Jan-SÃ¶ren Fischer with completing your PhD thesis at the University of Twente, in collaboration with NLR - Netherlands Aerospace Centre, and your great defense last Friday! I really enjoyed the discussions on the development of laminar wind design. Thanks to Bambang Soemarwoto, Edwin Van Der Weide, and Kees Venner for inviting me to be part of the your PhD committee, together with Bernard Geurts, Harry Hoeijmakers, Barry Koren, Prof. Cord-Christian Rossow and Prof. Bart Koopmans as chair. # <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rjamstevens_windturbine-windenergy-windpower-activity-6944591250985521152-YdPN>
