I find the discussion undisciplined, with many unsubstantiated claims. Where's the evidence? # <https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/05/26/the-case-against-revise-and-resubmit/>
I encourage you to realize asserting reality doesn't affect reality. I especially encourage you to realize changing the words you use to describe that reality definitely have no effect on that reality. # <https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/05/26/the-case-against-revise-and-resubmit/>
They have no data to support their conclusion. # <https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/05/26/the-case-against-revise-and-resubmit/>
Are you a mind reader? How do you know the male presenters used technical info to 'intimidate' women into leaving? # <https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/05/26/the-case-against-revise-and-resubmit/>
It is unclear what your piece adds to our knowledge. # <https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/05/26/the-case-against-revise-and-resubmit/>
This is the researcher making up information and pretending it's objective truth. # <https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/05/26/the-case-against-revise-and-resubmit/>
Even a sympathetic reader has reason to question the objectivity of the findings. # <https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/05/26/the-case-against-revise-and-resubmit/>
Don't be too downhearted at all my criticism - it is part of the learning process (I got trashed by my supervisor when I was a junior grad student too!). # <https://twitter.com/IngridAnell/status/1506916318892675074>
Those who suggest the other theory are idiots. We can say that tastes different and that it probably takes one to know one. # <https://twitter.com/IngridAnell/status/1369221047569031170>
It looks to me like one of your first attempts at scientific publishing, and I can understand that you are also writing in a non-native language. # <https://twitter.com/IngridAnell/status/1506915328705630214>
The project has no high scientific value. # <https://twitter.com/felix_w_s/status/949966029479915520>
I am afraid this manuscript may contribute not so much towards the field's advancement as much as toward its eventual demise. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/532976417366372352>
Your paper is appropriate for a beginning level biology class. # <https://twitter.com/Beyhbeel/status/720061938357706752>
The manuscript is generally interesting, however, too narrow in its scope for us. Also, the paper is badly written, and poorly organized. In its current form, the paper cannot be accepted. The paper is poorly written or poorly thought-out. I think the paper is poorly written and most of its statements are wrongly and poorly motivated. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/672285138221137920/the-manuscript-is-generally-interesting-however>
the authors seem to be reinventing the wheel and a flat tire to go along with it. # https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/672194505974349824/the-authors-seem-to-be-reinventing-the-wheel-and
If published, uneducated and misinformed statements like this would jeopardize the credibility of this journal. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/672103959531552768/if-published-uneducated-and-misinformed>
The authors past work (which is related closely to this) has gained some attention in the community: most of this is due to the wrong reasons. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/671922760392507392/the-authors-past-work-which-is-related-closely>
Returning to the introduction, the study rationale is unclear, the exact research question to be addressed poorly delineated and the overall motivation for the study poorly linked to the literature summary and aims of the study. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/670563781916672000/returning-to-the-introduction-the-study-rationale>
The arguments in the paper are compelling but not convincing. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/668298869218639872/the-arguments-in-the-paper-are-compelling-but-not>
I cannot imagine any physician or scientist who has a job, who will have the time to read this paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/668208823451992064/i-cannot-imagine-any-physician-or-scientist-who>
I thought that the author might be trying to "have it both ways." To be clear, this was just a passing thought and frankly, I read the manuscript about two weeks ago and don't remember the context, nor did I cross-walk one part of the essay with another to validate the thought. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/668208232417886208/i-thought-that-the-author-might-be-trying-to-have>
all I can say is that the author is blissfully unaware of what a standard is – in linguistic terms – and does not have the linguistic competence to describe it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/668117642929913856/all-i-can-say-is-that-the-author-is-blissfully>
To improve this you need to be more robust on all fronts etc. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/668039335815282688/to-improve-this-you-need-to-be-more-robust-on-all>
the whole premise just reverted the biosensor field back 20yrs, which has been my biggest single concern regarding this paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/667392492966133760/the-whole-premise-just-reverted-the-biosensor>
Despite promising a very general result this manuscript unfortunately does not deliver (almost) any of the things listed in the abstract. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/667392337051336704/despite-promising-a-very-general-result-this>
The turn of phrase "reaching out into the world"; is again just a vague rhetorical equivocation that is meant to add a semblance of an intellectual air to the text, a rhetorical attempt at being in fashion, but it dissolves only in empty intellectualism. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/667392160492060672/the-turn-of-phrase-reaching-out-into-the-world>
Is this a joke? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/667391958665347072/is-this-a-joke>
Indeed, the article as a whole shows a lack of sophistication and nuance that is diagnostic of the particular genre of thought pieces on the need for studying sex differences that it falls within # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/663776550522601472/indeed-the-article-as-a-whole-shows-a-lack-of>
While I personally enjoyed this contribution, I cannot escape the sense that this is much ado about very little, to paraphrase Shakespeare. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/650812206216249344/while-i-personally-enjoyed-this-contribution-i>
There are so many things wrong with this manuscript that I do not know where to begin. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/650628671978258432/there-are-so-many-things-wrong-with-this>
I read the first 6 pages of the paper. Sorry, I can't finish reading this paper. I certainly will not recommend anyone else. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/650557954086600704/i-read-the-first-6-pages-of-the-paper>
This is a very weak paper trying to bend things to build a relationship that does not exist. Stating X is totally wrong and your data does not support that and no model can state this. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/650557607479853058/this-is-a-very-weak-paper-trying-to-bend-things-to>
This is a confusing paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/649903884128698368/this-is-a-confusing-paper>
This was the moment when I stopped reading. Obviously the authors are not familiar with the research field. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/649813285225512960/this-was-the-moment-when-i-stopped-reading>
The authors have not bothered to learn the first thing about the theories they are hoping to refute with ill-designed experiments and muddled rationale. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/649722682764607488/the-authors-have-not-bothered-to-learn-the-first>

If this was taken from a successfully defended thesis, as it appears to have been, then he should not have been awarded a PhD. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/649541494084108288/if-this-was-taken-from-a-successfully-defended>
The title appears to me to be clickbait, and, as usual for clickbait, leads to disappointment. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/649450899310346240/the-title-appears-to-me-to-be-clickbait-and-as>
Maybe the clarity of stating the problem, purpose, method, finding, conclusion, and recommendation could be tweaked. Otherwise, congratulations on an outstanding contribution. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/649360294718603264/maybe-the-clarity-of-stating-the-problem>
This literature review is nothing more than a merry dance around the books. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/649278668431048704/this-literature-review-is-nothing-more-than-a>
The text is overly expansive, desultory, and often diaphanous, so that the raison d'être of an overarching theoretical structure is neither pellucid nor convincing. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/646093113639763968/the-text-is-overly-expansive-desultory-and-often>
The results look like a smorgasbord of data. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/641753936031875072/the-results-look-like-a-smorgasbord-of-data>
Despite the apparently impeccable arrangement of the essay, with headings and sub-headings, the progression of argument is not always transparent, often hindered by otiose wording. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/641663337548103680/despite-the-apparently-impeccable-arrangement-of>
Indeed, by the end of the paper, the reader is left with a feeling of 'so what now?' # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/641572742893797376/indeed-by-the-end-of-the-paper-the-reader-is>
If participants were recruited from a university, I imagine they would usually be 18-22 years old. Why does your sample range from 18 to 63? I'm a bit lost here. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/639500148776615936/if-participants-were-recruited-from-a-university>
The fact that the question of this paper has never been asked should, on balance, count against the paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/639499590684508160/the-fact-that-the-question-of-this-paper-has-never>

References are incomplete, listing only year and not volume, page numbers, etc. The lack of attention to this detail is a pet peeve. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/626273761763753984/references-are-incomplete-listing-only-year-and>
Large parts of the manuscript read now more like a Master thesis than a scientific paper. I hope that the more experienced co-authors - if there are any - can help with this aspect of style. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/625442705665916929/large-parts-of-the-manuscript-read-now-more-like-a>
Do we need to clarify the meaning of, "all"? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/625352111030501376/do-we-need-to-clarify-the-meaning-of-all>
While an interesting concept, in its current form, the approach taken is fundamentally inadequate and flawed for almost all use cases. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/625261497710428160/while-an-interesting-concept-in-its-current>
There is too much detail provided which is not relevant to the paper, or any for that matter. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I don't see much science in this manuscript. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I haven't read the word "audacity" yet in commenting on my reviews, so that is a first. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I don't see how your approach has potential to shed light on a question that anyone might have. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is a bit strange for me that authors have used Python for statistical analysis instead of SPSS or MATLAB as usual. Please, explain. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper could be considered for acceptance given a rewrite of the paper and change in the title and abstract. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The proposal is also poorly written and unfocused with only brief moments of meritorious thinking. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The scientific contribution of this paper - if there is any at all - is at best hopelessly insignificant. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
So overall we do not recommend a resubmission, but can let you try if you insist. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This discussion might be better directed to a different audience, perhaps an undergraduate class. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In my opinion, this is a fundamental wrong approach.
This paper makes no contribution. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The applicant does not address the broader impacts of the proposal, other than its potential benefit to global human health. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
My major concern to accept this work-in-progress paper is that these findings are not super interesting to readers in my opinion. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
But fundamentally, why did you bother? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The proposal is also poorly written and unfocused with only brief moments of meritorious thinking # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This work is antithetical to the spirit of the cited work and will impede potentially important developments. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Your discipline doesn't exist. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
However, bad language, weird sentences, half true statements and even nonsense statements continue throughout the draft, I refuse to review more of this draft until these language issues get fixed properly. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Publication of this paper will not advance our knowledge in any shape of form, it will just result in other researchers pointing out how bad this study actually is. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I have read this MS twice, which given the grammatical howlers in the Abstract would appear to be more times than it has been read by the authors. Given the lack of proof-reading and my concern over the methods used, I shall not comment beyond the end of the methods section, and shall comment selectively rather than exhaustively (which would indeed be exhausting). # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am personally offended that the authors believed that this study had a reasonable chance of being accepted to a serious scientific journal. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Did you have a seizure while writing this sentence? Because I feel like I had one while reading it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
While the authors do pick a good problem, that's where the quality of the paper ends for me. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I started reading this manuscript with much anticipation but my enthusiasm was short lived. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This result would be great if it were true. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a sin of omission! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The result does improve the state-of-the-art, but it is not strong enough for acceptance. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The supportive tone of this review took some effort. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I would advise the authors to go back to the drawing board and consider exactly what this paper is trying to do and do this well. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Yes measurements were made, but why, besides a teaching exercise, remains obscure. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors are amateurs. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In any aspect that this paper is different from prior research, it shouldn't be. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The first sentence is unfortunate. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper is very weak. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
When the reader is finished struggling through all the methods and results, he/she is left wondering whether it was worth the time. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There is hardly any paragraph (even in the abstract) that is not messy, disorganized, confusing, that does not contain mistakes (some are quite embarrassing), redundancies, abusive shortcuts or discussions that sound absurd. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Frankly, she knows nothing about invasion biology or the Great Lakes and should stick with what she does know. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Why was this submitted to a journal? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The presentation of the paper is difficult to follow for a hard scientist and it sometimes reads as if it were machine generated. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Most part of 'methodology' is useless, most of paragraphs are inrelevant to the main topics. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Sometimes I am diplomatic and sometimes critical, but this time I am resolute. I fail to see the contribution either to physics or social science. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a very difficult paper to review, and difficult - even painful - to read. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
X is inserted purely for fashion, adds nothing, and reflects the authors' belief/wish that fashionable papers regardless of logic or content have a larger chance of acceptance. Our community needs to combat this sort of unreflexive pseudo-scholarship. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Perhaps what I have written is deflating. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am sorry but this paper does not leave me satisfied. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I had no idea what this concept was until reading your paper, but your abstract wouldn't have made me want to read it had I not been a reviewer. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The experimental design is a bit funny. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I cannot make out signs of independent thinking, work beyond the state of the art, or anything ground-breaking. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This reviewer was a bit concerned about the results section given that it appears that participants in the current study were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
claiming 'insights' that rarely amount to very much beyond the bleeding obvious. the problem with jargon is that "any idiot can pick it up and have a go # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The results are as weak as a wet noodle. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The manuscript embarrassingly fails in addressing the declared aims. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There are two possibilities. 1) This paper is part of an experiment to try and determine how badly a research paper can be but still be accepted, or 2) The authors are actual fools and it would be in the editor's best interest to ban them from submitting to the journal in the future. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am, frankly, underwhelmed by the revisions. Most of the responses sound smooth, but really just written to avoid serious additional work. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I do not want to see the paper again. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
By the end of the paper, I was left with the impression that the lid had been lifted off a big can of worms, but that the worms had not been picked out for proper dissection. Maybe it is unfair to expect that this could be achieved, due to the excessive number of worms involved in the matter. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper is absolutely ridiculous. It shouldn't be published anywhere and the author should not be encouraged to revise. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Finally, I have substantial criticisms, in addition to the disappointment of seeing hoary old chestnuts. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Table 4 seems unnecessary given figure 8. Indeed, figure 8 also seems unnecessary. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The English language ranks this manuscript among the top 5 worst manuscripts I have ever reviewed. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
there is no evidence to show this is the first paper to propose the idea # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The writing is not at school level # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
An exercise in feature manipulation, of the brainless kind # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I apologize for this but frankly some parts read like a report of a high-school student on a scientific experiment. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There is no need to test these hypotheses. They have been tested a long time ago. It is in all textbooks. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This would seem to constitute the very minimum basic scientific requirement for attempting to publish a body of (unoriginal) data # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The entire paper reads a bit like someone who has searched around the social scientific research literature without much authentic understanding of social science, social scientific research methodology, or statistical analyses. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Which means that, as the saying goes, if their results are correct they cannot be new, and if they are "new" they cannot possibly be correct. Frankly, it is hard to say which is the case. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am not convinced if any clear real value of this research. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors are perpetuating misguided generalizations in the face of substantial experimental data to the contrary. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There are also other points that have to be addressed, but considering the current state of the manuscript, I do not think it is makes sense to go into further detail. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is very lengthy, full of mistakes, irrelevant information, and completely fails to attract readers. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Why chase a gene in this ridiculous organism? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Future work: The authors' personal research agenda is irrelevant here. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Line 306. The sentence follows a bit of a Yoda-esque grammar. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I just don't get the point of this. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I suggest you consult a competent statistical advisor. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is more of a blog post than a research article. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The sum total is frustration with what I can only call cavalier treatment of promising material. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
With the appropriate revisions these results could provide a very limited contribution to the field. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I have rarely read a more blown-up and annoying paper in the last couple of years than this hot-air balloon manuscript. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper introduces tools to answer questions which it does not seem many people are interested in. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In a nutshell, please cut out all the hype, show some integrity, and write a balanced paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The first problem is that the method - whatever it is and however it works - is insufficiently evaluated. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Since the paper is mathematically empty and, compared with the conference version, provides no new ideas or findings, # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
in general, I see no reason why it should be published in a journal as well. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This figure is silly. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Various statements seem to be sweeping and inaccurate generalizations with little robust justification # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The manuscript reads much like an unrevised masters level paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
You do not use the empirical data for the analysis, but the empirical data uses you # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The candidate demonstrates no understanding of the subject matter and his proposal title is misleading. Furthermore, his career prospects are unclear. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Since the manuscript is so lacking in all aspects, I won't bother going through it in detail. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The author does not exhibit adequate acquaintance with the subject under discussion, the scholarship on it, the structure of logical argument, or the writing of English. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Publishable, but why? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I believe that the authors have done scientific work, but in the current form of the paper it is impossible to judge it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The color rainbow is pretty, but largely useless. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors report results from pages 16-26. This section reflects what I would brutally call 'death by figures'. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I cannot possibly imagine what could have led the authors to believe that their paper was remotely interesting enough to submit for publication. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Usually climate studies do not show a good method for the proposed research. This is one of them. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is starting to feel like a book report. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
If the editor somehow decides to accept this paper, they risk permanently destroying the credibility of this journal and its entire editorial board. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Right now, there is zero rationale for the study and zero reason to read the study. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Details of how important these effects are are missing. Ref. 75 is entertaining but inadequate in this respect. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is essentially an opinion piece that editorializes shamelessly about the superior methods of a recent paper in the first person. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I have difficulties identifying the aim and added value of the present study to this topic. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The experiments are reasonable, but they fail the fundamental test of good science. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Your proposed method should be compared with another method that introduced in a prestigious paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Appears to be on the perimeter of meaningful investigation. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The rest of the Introduction is just as badly done as the first paragraph so I will not continue. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This article is on an interesting topic. Unfortunately there is no more positive to say about this manuscript. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The study is poorly conceived and inadequately conducted and the conclusions made by the authors do not necessarily follow from the results. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It reads more like a diagnosis confirmed by a set of examples. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Thus, there is nothing new in the manuscript that warrants publication in Science or most other scientific journals. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is safe to say that the authors want to see their paper published more than I really want to reject it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The work is trivial, and there is no novelty in the work, the approach or the results. The authors do not solve anything and the implications in this context are quite possibly irrelevant. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am sorry if I am missing something obvious here but this is not my area of work. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
First, the paper is for a large part incomprehensible. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper is presented as a rather undigestible and tortuous collection of disparate results. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Such a prestigious journal can surely make better use of its limited space. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper comes with proofs, but – at a first glance – they seem to be more cute than useful. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is hard to imagine researchers of this caliber being unaware of a half-century the field x, especially as concerns the bulk of what they have done in this paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I was really looking forward to reading this manuscript, however this enthusiasm soon waned. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
You are trying to do too much and end up accomplishing too little. It is a collection of good ideas that do not add up to or advance to any meaningful conclusion. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I felt like I was reading a horror movie - the scene where our protagonist leaves the door unlocked and says 'let's split up' to his/her comrades. and you know doom is surely going to reach our protagonist soon. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
That's not possible to do without mind-reading, and there's nothing in the Method section about mind-reading methods. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
And the Vygotsky reference is a straight-up drive-by citation, adding nothing except whatever luster he adds to the authors' claims. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
By now, there are over 1,000 articles on this topic, but these authors have not read a single one. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
How does the theory explain your results? Or really, your underwhelming results? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
While this study represents a substantial amount of work, it is not all that clear why the work was done. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I wish I could explain what is the purpose of the manuscript. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It seems that the author is simply engaged in proprietary phrase coining - advancing a new term for a well-researched phenomenon. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The team has generated the kind of gaudy, brobdignagian dataset that makes it such a curious and exciting time. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
So many electrons worked so very very hard on this paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The discussion is inappropriate and the new content is generally poorly written. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It just doesn't make sense. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In a nutshell, I am not sure if the problem is indeed a challenge or just a fact that we have to live with, such as gravity or death, for which no solutions exist. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Moreover, it is unclear whether the effect is sufficiently important to warrant replication. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is worth saying that I am not convinced that you contribute to the evidence base in this paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
That's not how science is done. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors conclusions not only contradict their own data but also the laws of thermodynamics. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I really don't like to be harsh in my reviews, but # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
However I deplore the fact that this paper has been created at all. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
While I think there is good reason to have performed this work, it does make for unexciting reading. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Authors wanted to make title catchy but actually finished trivial title, a la 'Daily mail'. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
While the problem is a very important one for modern society, the topic and lessons are not of broad interest. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Line 156-160; this is the only correct, sensible and interesting finding of the paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It feels a little bit like someone wanting to run a series of statistics. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Simply conducting the same analyses in a different data set does not equate novelty or impact to the field. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Are the "10 random reps" chosen at random? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors need to add a level of puzzlement to their interpretations. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
One wonders whether the analysis was an exercise in using a cannon to open an unlocked door. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This work is only a maths game. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Overall, I think this manuscript is a waste of time. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Moreover, it is very difficult to see the actual contribution this manuscript will have. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The abstract is intriguing but confusing. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I guess this proposal could be interesting, if you're interested in this obscure sect of biology. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I don't understand thermodynamics. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
A great deal of effort has been expended here, but to what end? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper is desperate. Please reject it completely and then block the author's email ID so they can't use the online system in the future. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The Discussion section of the paper is neither informative nor enlightening and is certainly theoretically questionably. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Intermediary steps and the apologetics derived from an ahistorical cult and its author. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The team is very experienced. The paper felt a bit less self referential than they often are. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Sorry for our long silence, due to some perplexity on our side at reading your manuscript. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I recommend the publication even if I am not impressed. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
If the author is comfortable having his/her name on this paper, then I won't stand in the way of its publication. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am impatient with this vague assertion. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The length of this review is occasioned by the density of error and misconceived arguments in this manuscript. As a service primarily to the authors I have decided to actually try to convey a sense of the extreme nature of the problems encumbering this submission. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this paper for publication because its contents violate the laws of physics. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors are permitted to believe what they want to, but the data did not support "important implications." # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
However, the applicant seems to have run out of steam before he developed a detailed plan for the proposed research and then completed the proposal. This is unfortunate. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This book has more mistakes than a hound has fleas. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I did not attempt to understand Figure 2 because there was no motivation given for it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It looks to be more of a chance for the authors to promote a product using a poorly constructed, non-replicable pilot study. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In order to be able to publish this manuscript it needs to be rewritten in the form of a scientific article. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Through a streamlining of the argument, meaningful references to existing literature and a restriction to the essentials, the manuscript may still be saved. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This sentence is so hard to digest it gave me reflux. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I also thing that the English of the manuscript need further polishing. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I also thing that the English of the manuscript need further polishing. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is difficult from this reviewer's perspective to even call these studies. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The take home message has to be extracted with significant labor from a punishing set of figures with multiple bar graphs. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
suggesting much but saying nothing of import, the sort of balderdash that is in the vernacular often compared to the waste of certain male ruminants. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
What, then, is the point of this manuscript, which presents no truly new data, methods, conclusions, or arguments? I would venture that it has no raison d'etre, and is neither novel nor helpful. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
this may eventually be a cited paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Ugh. Read a book. This is grossly oversimplified, and not an appropriate statement for a scientific journal. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper is poorly written. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Even if other readers found it comprehensible, there is not even a proposed path to make into a modeling system. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper was so boring I fell asleep halfway through. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The system described in the manuscript is inherently confusing. Despite re-reading, its basic elements did not make sense. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
High was my expectation, and so much deeper was my disappointment. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
To my mind the question [the paper is about] is similar to to the medieval debate concerning angels dancing on pinheads. I do not think the paper should be published. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Your research paper is not motivated. There is no motivation behind your algorithm. Your results lack motivation. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In other words: the referee thinks this work is stuck in the past. The referee would rather talk about the future - some of the senior co-authors were the future once! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The results section is not great (boring). # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This made the paper very long and may bore the reader # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The study is largely descriptive in nature and mostly a fishing expedition. It will be great if they catch some interesting or unexpected fish. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The manuscript is a collection of fragmented and disconnected descriptive observations. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is clearly a submission that needs to be shredded, burned, and the ashes buried in multiple locations. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I think the audience will eat him alive. But I want to be there to hear it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The current manuscript is deceptive and I do not recommend its publication. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There is an over-reliance on sophisticated statistics at the expense of good old fashioned, scientific thought # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The title is the closest I've seen to manuscript clickbait # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This manuscript uses half of the available pages, and fails to explain what has been done, how and why # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I would like to urge the authors to improve the language description to make the manuscript much clear and logic. A professional language expert is recommended to use # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This section gives the impression that you'll throw a handful of darts at a target and see what you happen to hit. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It seems like you are torturing the data until the model converges. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The chapter is too scholarly and too casual # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
one could call this name-dropping # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Unfortunately I was hoping for more. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Lots of hand waving in this Discussion # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In the experimental part there is a lack of scientific by taking over results from reference literature. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I find myself disagreeing with most of this papers conclusions # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The writer of the manuscript is utterly ridiculous and appears to believe they will solve poverty through radio astronomy. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Having read through this a couple of times I have ended up feeling rather depressed. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The manuscript is too long for what the authors have to say. However, additional text is required as outlined below. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Fig 3e is fanciful, verging on silly. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Being the first is not the best motivation. For example, I could be the first one to jump of the SBE building with a triple back flip and no safety net. I'd be the first (I think) and it would even be quite spectacular (I'm sure), but that doesn't make it a good idea. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
They have addressed most of the reviewer comments, although their responses to a few of them remind me of Donald Trump. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The way the study is framed here and in the main body comes off as straw-mannish. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The abstract is ok in the context of a weak manuscript # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper is an old fashioned one # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I feel the results are insufficiently counter-intuitive to warrant publication. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The only conceivable contribution this paper can make is by providing the academic community with an alternative to counting sheep. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1321067062660341760>
Most of the work is methodological rather than scientific, making it somewhat boring. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The underlying science here is quite interesting, but the presentation does its best to disguise it # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper is about combining inflexible specifications in a flexible way. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The investigator is in the top 50% of his field # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Focus on limitations, because they are many! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper descends into nonsense, never to return, on line 44. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is at best of little value and, in the worst case, irrelevant and offensive. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The scales appear to be not divided into quartiles as stated, but rather are based on the distribution of the data (into quartiles). # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I find the title and the main premise of the abstract confusing and illogical. The key concept has the logic of a Monty Python sketch # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The data you have are weak, based on very small samples, not clear that they were analyzed properly, and are based on measurements taken in the wrong medium for the organisms. I see little of value in this paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This manuscript is not publishable in a reasonable sense # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
is 'bisexuals' referring to the entire sample or those who identify solely as bisexual? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
You should consider consulting a competent statistical adviser. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
the correlations are not that strong (e.g., p = .022) # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This work is not an easy topic. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The first problem in the 'Theoretical Analysis' section is trivial and requires no analysis, as any sensible schoolkid can identify its solution. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
..incoherent babble of unsubstantiated overstatement. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The biggest problem with this manuscript, which has nearly sucked the will to live out of me, is the terrible writing style. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a paper struggling not to die # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This manuscript is obviously not suitable for publication in high impact factor journals. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Pity about the main thesis. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
And finally comes the conclusion, which is the intellectual equivalent of bubblegum. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a well-intentioned but naïve and unscholarly presentation of a point of view that is not well-supported by evidence – a polemic, not a review # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I really want to like this study. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The citations of those two writers are cursory, almost impressionistic (in the negative sense of the term). # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper is so bad I cannot even reject it! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The novelty is my most concern # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I find this submission confusingly and not always grammatically written. The aims and objectives seem rather muddled. References are rather sparse. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The results are new but were predictable. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There are numerous problems with this paper, starting with the title. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors should take the time to thoroughly refine and revise manuscripts before they are sent to innocent reviewers. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper is overlong, very verbose and contains unnecessary repetition. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It would be wholly inappropriate to randomize living people to an intervention. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It would be wholly inappropriate to randomize living people to an intervention. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I'm a bonehead so maybe I missed this? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There are a bunch of other things going on that could be spuriously related. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
My disappointment when finding flawed analyses, conclusions, and terminology was therefore substantial # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is rather clear that the paper is incomplete and hastily submitted. Note that you failed to provide the contribution number in the acknowledgements. The paper is NOT COMPLETE' # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In the list of authors, one wonders whether these authors read the manuscript # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In the list of authors, one wonders whether these authors read the manuscript # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This lack of familiarity with the literature is admittedly a bit unnerving, but hey that's what peer-reviews are for # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Nobody in their right mind would ever suggest such a model # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors avoid making mistakes in the analysis of the data by not making any. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This proposal uses an impressive set of state-of-the-art tools and uses cutting edge technologies. However, this is what makes this project extremely dangerous for the future of science. If its results are published, they will set a simplified (and potentially wrong) paradigm for chromatin regulation in epithelia, which will be taught to future generations of scientists thus having a long-term detrimental impact on the field. Altogether, this makes this proposal the worst I have reviewed over the past three years. # <https://twitter.com/BLadoux/status/1531644121034670080/photo/1>
I have read this paper several times through, and I have nothing to say in its defense. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1023866256217305088>
My recommendation for the authors is therefore to shelve the manuscript # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1481592696116592641>
I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why this paper was written. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1171442989073219584>
The manuscript presents the results of a meta-analysis which seems to be based on very abundant but very poor primary data # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1300354281950896129>
The reported mean of 7.7 is misleading because it appears that close to half of your participants are scoring below that mean # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1462920037115654148>
Given the pedigree of the senior author, I would have expected better # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1440690083019980820>
The lack of theory is painful at times # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1427597211014205440>
I'm disappointed but not surprised with your work # <https://twitter.com/ispeakastronomy/status/1426576058678226951>
This study is weak. not innovation # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1419755584166014979>
it is impossible for the reader to keep track of the hundreds (thousands?) of acronyms in the paper. If there ever is an award for most acronyms in a paper, this one would win it hands down. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1417727575376412673>
I think the author could reduce the amount of equation to a proper level and describes the basic principle. To be honest, those equations make me a little headache # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1414916559127072774>
The author should abandon the premise that his work can be considered research. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1414890490567307273>
Your model is a black hole from which no light escapes # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1409894449241526277>
I appreciated how the author seemingly had in mind that a goodly percentage of the readership are not native speakers, so anything too academic or erudite might be lost on them # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1409787753982726150>
The paper presents the appearance of competence but is deeply flawed. # <https://twitter.com/kyliesoanes/status/1390151287811973120>
Though we do occasionally publish qualitative papers, yours did not reach sufficient levels of illumination to justify the pages # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1387398182200545284>
Overall, the paper is has a rambling quality to it, interlaced with fluff # <https://twitter.com/droxburgh/status/1383940630762573829>
I urge the authors to not publish this article anywhere, as it will impede the progress of scientific understanding. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1362705319902785537>
The way the results of this paper are overblown grants it a straight rejection and a cautionary advise to the more senior co-author - it is clear that they have not read this paper through, nor contributed much to its writing. I understand there should be some Covid-19 related impacts in many a paper these days, but there are just too major weaknesses in this work, and only the discussion appears in this manuscript as showing some coherency (the only part edited properly?). # <https://twitter.com/seis_matters/status/1353646555505504256>
The paper is also unnecessarily sprawling, verbose, and heavy on extended descriptive exposition of other people's views. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1122940363277258753>
Overall, I don't quite get what the authors think they've accomplished. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1140684138472714241>
The authors last name sounds Spanish. I didn't read the manuscript because I'm sure it's full of bad English # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1216373482084323329>
It would take a great deal of time to sort this out. From what little I can glean from the scientific nature of this submission, addressing the comments listed above will not yield a submission suitable for this journal. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1327252848103583752>
In addition, I would suggest either activating the spellchecker on Word, or keeping the cat from walking on your keyboard. I think one of your words was previously employed as a Thunder in "Finnegan's Wake". # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1321066874948493312>
This paper is to science as astrology is to astrophysics # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1318101374522085376>
The Gettysburg Address was only 272 words, and was one of the most powerful speeches in history. This paper, on the other hand, is over 8,000 words and says absolutely nothing at all. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1167800252302266368>
The presentation is of a standard that I would reject from an undergraduate student # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1220063168283774977>
The so-called XX test is incompetent, irrelevant, immaterial and without any foundation whatsoever in the established literature # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1313434607564582912>
I am concerned that so many trees died for this to be the result. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1311281379313963008>
The lead author of this study has an apparent history of convincing otherwise well-respected scholars to be unwitting co-authors on his poor excuses for academic papers # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1311280899259076612>
Unrealistic problems. Unrealistic solutions. # <https://twitter.com/sweis/status/1304563315616542720>
I find this a 'smart-looking' house built on a weak and shifty foundation # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1300510639627145217>
Exhaustive pages of statistical and meta-analytic data and results which seem rather redundant are presented, about 60+ pages of minute analyses of each possible particle of data. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1299056336920031235>
It appears the authors has generated reports in a hurry, compiled, and presented as an article # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1298226968018722816>
While I won't advocate strongly for its publication, I also would not object to its publication in the journal # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1298226436696952837>
They present an irresponsibly unbalanced literature review of the issues at hand and design an experiment that is ill suited to address the stated aims of the paper. Make major errors in statistical reasoning in an attempt to support their claims, and make completely unreasonable conclusions based on their results. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1296843759255199750>
As such, this paper is not suitable for publication in a peer reviewed scientific journal of any sort # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1295279504085131265>
The PI is an excellent networker but that he does not have sufficient required scientific expertise and capacity to successfully execute the project # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1293839324279115777>
I really don't like to be harsh in my reviews, but did you even read what you wrote? Trash of a paper! # <https://twitter.com/YGadama/status/1291215652531974145>
If this is the quality of work coming from Harvard's junior faculty, I weep for the future. # <https://twitter.com/MichelleM_Mello/status/1276651766428209152>
The author's spelling of coordinate, while technically correct, is arcane and annoying. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1274604541594546176>
I am not aware of a published citation that justifies these calculations, but I have really not felt the need for such a citation given the straightforward computation # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1270424495535403013>
Many questions on the text, for example, cause embarrassment in understanding the text # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1266299189496967172>
The statistical results are overly statistical. # <https://twitter.com/jennemurray/status/1263130820627357696>
The paper suffers from its desire to be accessible and directly impactful # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1263762267017023488>
The only redeeming aspect of this manuscript is that it is so poorly written that it fails to convey the incorrect conclusions drawn here # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1256187025109237760>
I hesitated to suggest this manuscript to be rejected, but I handled to the (naive?) idea that this actual pumpkin can turn into a fair-looking princess. # <https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks/status/1250787467319545858>
The writing and data presentation are so bad that I had to leave work and go home early and spend time to wonder what life is about. # <https://www.humanities.hk/news/this-paper-is-absolutely-ridiculous-ken-hyland>
In addition to tough comments, these evaluations were expressed unequivocally using a range of boosters and attitudinal markers # <https://www.humanities.hk/news/this-paper-is-absolutely-ridiculous-ken-hyland>
This paper must be rejected, because the work it describes is clearly impossible. # <https://www.humanities.hk/news/this-paper-is-absolutely-ridiculous-ken-hyland>
Only the meagerest of efforts was required to see the value, or lack there of, of this work # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Utterly disappointed in this submission, it achieves nothing, and was a waste of funding # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Either the authors didn't read my previous review or they are unable to grasp the subtleties # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
I have rewritten so much of this troubled paper that I should be included as an author # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
There inability to grasp even the basic elements of my previous comments makes me hesitant to offer even more comments as they will just not understand them # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
The authors clearly do not understand even the simplest aspect of….. # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
It was garbage when I read it first and its still garbage # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Analysis was bad and made me forget what I already knew about ANOVA # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Your rebuttal on the surface appears intelligent but shows a tragic lack of depth and your personal limitations # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Their refusal to make my suggested changes shows their poor understanding of science # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
The authors use a method that they developed and which so far only they use. I wonder why that is # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
This manuscript was not worth my time so I did not read it and recommend rejection # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
The issue addressed here is so obvious it is clear a lack of originality will limit them # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
As English is clearly a problem I suggest other authors give this a good read # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
I tried to find something redeeming but failed to do so # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
I did not give a detailed review as the work was not worth it # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
The authors are either clearly incompetent or purposely misrepresent their work # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Seems strange the authors would be unaware of this basic fact # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Given the quality of this work I question the apparent qualifications of the authors # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
The authors clearly have little experience with these methods # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
The writing is awful # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
I hope senior colleagues can help salvage this # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
naive and simplistic view # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
If the authors want to publish knowing the results are unreliable I guess that is there problem # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
It is clear the authors are not native English speakers # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
this is wishful thinking # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
consult any book about this topic # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
clearly the authors are following a template they picked up somewhere # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
as is common from research from China # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
if they were more fully informed they would go with the latest science, which is machine learning # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
basically follow a fantasy set up # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
this paper and its science will be another one of the hollow and non-achieving papers # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
the authors seem to think their goals are scientifically valid # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
I mean, how outdated is that # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
the authors provide us with a nice example what they can, and cannot do, and how they (wrongly) understand nature and ecology # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
With so many native English speaking co-authors, it should be easy to rectify this # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
authors feel forced  to create artificial importance # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
It leaves me with the feeling that authors a very partial view on the topic or are just not familiar with the literature # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Considering your methods, this is too pretentious # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
attempt to convince a naive general audience that # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
basically cute jargon that does not add to level of understanding # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
that is totally distracting, just the author trying to be clever # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
the results of this experiment are difficult to believe. # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
the authors have created a novel and worthless metric that completely obscures # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
If there are any solid results from this experiment # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
the result of attending university in a developing country # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
this young lady is lucky to have been mentored by the leading men in the field # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
I'm not sure if the discussion could be even more basic # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Pointless tests of widely accepted phenomenon? Maybe. # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
But the experimental design is decidedly 'old fashioned' # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
I stingily recommend that a native English speaker goes through the MS and sorts out some of the harder to understand parts. # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Authors should ask for help of a colleague whose first language is English, # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
This is dismal to read, # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Nothing new is added, why was this study even done? # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
The experiments to determine this is obvious, so their inability to conduct them is baffling # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
other methods are available to collect actual data # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
why they bother to even resubmit this is beyond me # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
maybe get a native English speaker to proofread the manuscript # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
this is worthless, hence I totally ignore # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
would be lucky to be published in a less prestigious journal let alone # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
A native English speaker would # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
No contrasts with other studies! They are either behind latest advances or left these studies out to inflate their own impact # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
they have FINALLY incorporated my earlier comments # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Another review on a a topic that has collect so many reviews that nothing new is ever added # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
This writing in the introduction is not high quality and should be reviewed by a native English speaker # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Discussion was dull # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
This section was very dull # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
Discussion was boring # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
carefully proof-read by a native speaker. # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
in a methodologically grossly inadequate manner, which is further highlighted by the fact that the trial was unethical # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
the writing of this paper was atrocious # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
the authors are clearly new to this field and it shows in this work. # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
it is convenient that you didn't mention # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
methods used violate basic precepts of animal welfare # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
I find it impossible to believe they were unaware of the work of # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
it leaves me with the feeling that authors present a very partial view on the topic or are just not familiar with the literature # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
this is JUST wrong # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
much more likely that predation was the driving factor # <https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-020-00096-x>
The standard of writing (including spelling and grammar) is also satisfactory. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/post/109669745693/the-standard-of-writing-including-spelling-and>
Probably switching to Bayesian stats will be too difficult for many scientists and especially students in the less intelligent fields (e.g. psych) # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Please, also perform spell checking and proof-reading. Too much of typos! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I perused this manuscript while in the hotel prior to a friend's wedding. I was suspicious that a state of relaxation had influenced my enjoyment of a paper on soil formation; so I read it again, this time squashed between two large people on the delayed flight home, and still enjoyed reading it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The original study was published in PsycScience. This is just some work by a grad student. Reject. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Not now, not ever. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
'Qualitative tracing, correlational variables' – what are they? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Why not do the study in vivo instead of in vitro? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In my view the manuscript provides a relatively superficial summary of the area which lacks any attempt at interpretation or novelty. It is adequate only as a light topical treatment for a broad audience. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I find the author's writing to be very undergraduate-like. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In summary, while I believe the work to be valid, timely, original and relevant, I am unable to see in what sense this work accords to the strict journal's criteria. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In my opinion they are overly reliant on statistical analyses and fail at times to actually see if the observed data agrees with the statistical evaluation. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper is too difficult for a journal on Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a disaster. I could continue, but you see my point. You do seem to have a story in mind, but you do a poor job at presenting it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Can you explain this part a bit further, but without going into detail? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I concur with the reviewers that the methods are insufficient and thus the conclusion are totally overblown. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper is definitely exploratory, but probably not of interest to people other than the author. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There is a very interesting story to be conveyed in this paper. The problem is that this interesting story is hidden behind layers of mud, and it is obscured because the paper is poorly written and badly organised. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I do not have the background to assess the accuracy or to detect errors in the equations but I do not agree with this. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Perpetuating the recognition of this as a valid species in the face of irrefutable evidence is dilettantish and scientifically unacceptable # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors are also treating what might be called a "boutique" version within a model that is already considered by many to be a "boutique" model. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors should discard the data and collect it again properly. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is always rather pleasant to recommend that a paper be rejected. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I urge the authors to not publish this article anywhere, as it will impede the progress of scientific understanding # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Some papers are a pleasure to read. This is not one of them. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I was originally very excited to review this paper, since such a bridge would span uncharted lands – here be dragons! High was my expectation, and so much deeper was my disappointment # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Not good. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Why exactly this task? I can think of a zillion other cognitive tasks # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am concerned that the survey data for this report were collected in 2005, 15 years ago. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This manuscript was neither enjoyable nor informative to read # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It's like you sat around and dreamed up ideas, except they're just castles in the air # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I have reviewed many manuscripts in my career and I have never seen so many repeated mistakes of this type. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
As it is often the case with conceptual developments, most of it doesn't make a lot of sense, in the end # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper is baffling. In particular, I have not looked at all at section 2 of the paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Written in parts like an experience track paper, minus the experience. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
My first concern is that I don't get it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The beekeeping example also fails to convince. There is no discussion of bees' actual lived experience. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The overall tenor is disturbingly glossy and pretentious given the gravity of the topic # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This looks like a work of pure fantasy. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There are far too many typos and grammatical mistakes. I started to correct these but got annoyed. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I now turn to my best guess about what the authors might be doing. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The following discussion seems to ignore this major flaw, which turns mere arm-waving into Olympic-level calisthenics # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper was authored by a keen blogger and his colleagues. The paper perhaps reflects this informal approach, to its detriment. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Use of words like 'performativity' (is that a word?) # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is very well done, but sits somewhat in isolation from other schools of thought. It is -and I mean this with no disrespect to the author - a sort of echidna or platypus of a paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I would drop the first clause in the paper title. It does nothing other than degrade the scientific integrity of the work. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I recommend the publication even if I am not impressed # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Quite frankly, it seems that the technical language is used more to frighten and take power over the reader rather than to facilitate the reader in his task, that should be to understand the results of the work (if there are any) # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
These snotty kids in quantum information # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I would very much have liked to read the article promised in the abstract. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Overall, the superheated sense of justification and self-advertising on display here are simply demeaning. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The conclusion drawn by the authors seems self explanatory and does not require any validation through the presented work # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It will be a fantastic work if the authors could deeply presented the dominating of study discussed in detail and less overstaffed on the majority of studies discussed, which may give necessary details in tables to show their similarities or differences, as well as, advantages or disadvantages by your own letters. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I don't know what to 'do' with this. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Bad, very bad. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is madness, frankly, almost regardless of how it was implemented. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This left me somewhere between scratching my head and pulling my hair out # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
If you aren't going to make to the effort to understand, then you should just give up # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The map on the article is entirely unscientific. The data itself is also very dubious. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
You need a comma here. Do they not have commas at your institution or do they just cost a lot? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Your content is stellar, and your writing is excellent. However, you should consider hiring an editor for subsequent revisions before submitting again. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Is this not the most frightening finding of all? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a long and tedious manuscript # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is unclear how this would advance the field beyond providing additional, previously unknown information. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This was one of the least interesting papers that I have read in quite some time. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Figure 1. What does "Min" in panel c stand for? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is (I'm sorry) utter nonsense. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The ms comes over very much like a group of old wise men sitting around mulling over the terrible state of the world, and opening their hands and saying: well, what can we do about all these terrible things around us # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Lots of work, effort, but no real science. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper does have some moderately interesting results. But by the time I had gone past Section 3.2, I lost interest because there was nothing that took me by surprise or wonder. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I think there is a general problem with the overall goal of this study and area of research. This seems to be making data usage a critical thing people should be paying attention to. People have real issues and I am not at all sure that this one deserves attention. They have real concerns like, are they going to lose their job, where should their children go to college, should they encourage their elderly parents to move into a retirement center. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It appears that publication in any form would be premature at this time. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Often sounds like a precocious high-school student who is trying to show off how clever he is # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There is so much that is wrong with this paper that it is difficult to know where to start # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Add statistical support! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a potentially interesting problem. Yet, not all potentially interesting problems are useful, such as this one. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
To Review of the article was therefore a challenge which I accepted. In fact I regret this decision, at least to some degree. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It reads as if the author were giving a lecture and wandered off point to tell an interesting story. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
You were either in a rush or you do not care too much about getting your paper accepted # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
No respectable biochemist would be seen in the same county as these data. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Is 'Tartarstan' a magical land where they make all the world's tartar sauce? If not, I can only assume the author is referring to the Russian republic of Tatarstan. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The author gives the impression of having had some mathematical training. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The results are obvious. In fact, so obvious that perhaps no one has bothered to write them down before. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The biggest value of this paper lies in the fact that its pages are bound together. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Table 5 is a beast. I have no idea what it is trying to say because it terrifies me # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper is not well written. It most presents itself as a long line of known definitions and theorems,but I am no expert in these matters. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I'm sorry, this topic is just not very interesting # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The work that this group does is a disgrace to science # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I have started reading this paper with great interest, but as I progressed in reading my interest has decreased significantly. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Given the way the paper was structured, I felt I had to read most of it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
You're really funny. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
For a section on thought, very little seems to have gone into it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I also do not feel that the lead PI is qualified to undertake this work, or more accurately, that she should undertake this work; # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The figure is really not needed. Were I to be shown this by a psychologist, I suspect I would hire a replacement # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The analyses are too statistic # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
So the paper, which I was initially excited to read, ended up just making me mad. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
What is disturbing is that the author was not adequately supervised or otherwise assisted by faculty at her institution. They failed her completely in providing oversight and input. Young and inexperienced researchers should never be placed in a position of subjecting themselves to the painful rigors of critical reviews without guidance prior to submitting. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am not sure why there is a full section about limitations, this in itself says a lot about the study. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Despite all my efforts I failed to understand what the actual focus of this paper is # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The findings are not novel and the solution induces despair. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is early in the year, but difficult to imagine any paper overtaking this one for lack of imagination, logic, or data—it is beyond redemption # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I've never read anything like it & I do not mean it as a compliment # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It amounts to story-telling # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The enormous and overwhelming -not to say pathetic- admiration, even adoration of the author for her subject is barely acceptable anymore for a modern biography. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Was the white noise random? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I recommend acceptance, provided the editors are willing to stretch the standards for publication a bit # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
To me the question is uninteresting # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In the course of this paper many stones were thrown but, unfortunately, no birds were harmed. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The research team cooked up a great filet mignon. Instead of mushrooms and an exquisite French sauce, we got American ketchup. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The peaceful atmosphere between Christmas and New Year was transiently disrupted by reading this manuscript. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I want to vomit; I can't believe this paper was submitted. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is not a paper. This is part of... something. It cannot be reviewed and should be rejected right on. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The writing and data presentation are so bad that I had to leave work and go home early and then spend time to wonder what life is about. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It reads like papers often do when they are written in LaTeX. Reject. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I started to review this but could not get much past the abstract. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I found the use of the evolutionary theory problematic. This is a highly contested theory and the authors did not strongly justify their decision to use it, nor attend to some of the major flaws of the theory. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I now have had a chance to look at this paper. I think it is a bit of a joke. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Didn't like this one # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
They show they can account for 20% of the variance. No wonder. The usually accepted level is 50% to be useful. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors use a log transformation, which is statistical machination, intended to deceive # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
What is a 'systematic' review? I have never heard of an unsystematic review. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
You aimed for the bare minimum, and missed! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This article reads like the work of a reasonably competent undergraduate. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This looks like a very early draft # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The writing is often arrestingly pedestrian. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
presumptuous, ignorant and downright dangerous. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper reads like a woman's diary, not like a scientific piece of work # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Limited scholarship, flawed design, and faulty logic engender no enthusiasm whatsoever. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
If you want to solve a puzzle you could just do sudoku. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Find your inner nerd—it must be a big part of you—bind and gap it and then dump it in the ocean tied to a large rock. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
While it unfortunately doesn't make for a flashy title (which the authors like more than British tabloids do), there is a simple alternative interpretation of their results # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I don't believe in simulations # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Did all 5 authors say,"Yes, this is a piece of work I am proud to have my name on? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It (paper) has a kind of self-help quality to it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors should either retract the manuscript or completely revise it after completing the study and by following common scientific standards # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There is no point in commenting on the statistical overkill in the submission. It simply should not have happened. It should never happen again. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
No new insights, no important question addressed, no problem solved. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Maybe the authors should cite a reference intended for non-mathematicians (e.g., Burnham and Anderson 2002) instead of Akaike (1974), which I doubt that they have read and understood. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
You have put in a lot of effort answering a question that should have never been asked # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Sprinkled here and there are some things, also taken from his readings, that are more or less correct. But it is all very confused. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Many of the most serious errors are more or less just copied out from what he has read, so it is hard to know how to deal with such cases. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is clear that the author has read way too much and understood way too little. Many of the most serious errors are more or less just copied out from what he has read, so it is hard to know how to deal with such cases. Sprinkled here and there are some things, also taken from his readings, that are more or less correct. But it is all very confused. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper failed to make the reviewers more than semi-excited # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The title of the paper indicates that the study was an RCT, but was it? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
You need to learn how to think inside the box and stop smoking whatever it is you're smoking' # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Why do you have so many tables? Did you go to Ikea? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In my feeling, no attempt has been made to create a coherent manuscript. The repetitions throughout the text and other deficiencies are so obvious that I suspect that none of the authors had ever read it from the beginning to the end. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The methods section reads more as if these explanations are put in to guide the authors themselves # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Given the dodgy sampling technique, one could and should wonder how useful it is to include a variable with so little explained variance # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The manuscript in the present form is not a review article but is rather a number of research papers stapled together. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The whole paper reminds me of a paper of a couple of years ago, which I didn't like. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The data as presented is not very convincing, even to a believer. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The research questions are vague, which makes them uninteresting # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The article could benefit from a good linguistic editing in order for it to be better sound and flowing. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am sure that you would find what you expect, but I question its value as research # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I don't think this study would add anything to either theory or practice # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I would refrain from using enumerations in your paper and instead encourage you to think about the deep masculinism that comes with # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
'Hypothesized' is such an ugly word # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I don't know what the heck the red highlighted text is supposed to mean and left it as is. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Something is missing. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is depressing! So much work with so little science # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
You know there is something important there but the language is so inaccessible that you cannot make up your mind if they are trying to hide something or they actually think that is a good style of writing. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is an interesting paper but it is not relevant # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is all science done by wishful thinking. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is rather clear that the paper is incomplete and hastily submitted. Note that you failed to provide the contribution number in the acknowledgements. The paper is NOT COMPLETE' # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The overall value of this manuscript is not so much that this is novel, groundbreaking research as it is a demonstration of opportunistic sampling and analysis. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Currently, the impression is that this was simply another piece of research/consultation. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This application for a postdoctoral fellowship has few strengths other than the applicant's dogged and stubborn effort to do studies he conceptualized much earlier in his career and for which he has struggled to find a home. … His letters of recommendation contain, at best, faint praise and mainly focus on his stubborn determination to pursue his long-term goal. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Some self citations may be easily taken out without harming the paper # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Do we really need concepts and theories to discuss inequalities among young adults? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Based on theoretical considerations I don't see a reason to perform these experiments. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Please also consider making the submission looking less like an advertising booklet rather than a research paper—at least, try not to mention the X system in every paragraph. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper raises the suspicion that the author has not been trained as a historian # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There is essentially nothing unexpected, although the central observation of X is an unexpectedly large and important effect. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This seems like a fishing expedition, please explain why the parameters tested were use for correlation testing? There should be some rational behind all of this, please describe. Figure 5, unclear what is on the y-axis???? Please specify. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I see this article as a short distillation of someone's project notebook. When Michelangelo finished his masterpiece on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, did he also try to sell the scaffolding as a separate piece of art? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Findings are presented in an anecdotal, descriptive style that I can't interpret. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Not only does this strike me as the worst kind of postmodern legerdemain, but if true the statement would transform ethics into a hopelessly muddled enterprise. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This study has the same problem with focusing on a garbage-can group that is not uniformly sampled and has no evolutionary cohesion. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There is potentially an interesting essay to be written about this subject, but this one isn't it . # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Furthermore, the manuscript is very difficult to read due to English problems: combining results and discussion section making it even more confusing. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The manuscript is poorly written although it can be follow with lots of typos, and a review by a native English speaker is clearly needed. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The fact that something has not been studies is not, in itself, a reason why it should be studied. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Reading this made my brain melt. Very true though. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The description of the participants is too cryptic. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I have followed the work of this group for the last few years and know that their submitted work is usually well polished. That is not the case for the present paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I showed this paper to my nurses and they agreed there was nothing new reported here. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The figure in the supplementary material is a mystery to me. Where did all this sound energy go? It defies the basic laws of physics. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a pretty trivial study, sample size is suspiciously high, and the effect is tiny at 5% percent difference (who cares if it is significant). # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors should refer to the super interesting article on this topic in Wikipedia. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is not hard to develop this method. I could write code for this on a rainy afternoon. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
To be frank, it was boring to read once one got past the beginning. This is rather ironic given the paper is about humour. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
One gets the feeling that the references were included for the sake of having something to refer to. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Generally, some extra clarification might be nice to improve clarity. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Also, the manuscript is very tedious and reads like an unedited thesis chapter. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Though less enthused about manuscript's novelty, this reviewer does admire the hardworking of your group. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Also, the authors criticize the approach of X shortly before introducing their own approach. Seems somewhat hypocritical to me. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The introduction, general approach and data analyses are somewhat anachronistic–this study would have been really interesting 10-15 years ago, but now it seems quite out of date. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The ideas behind the project seem to be a combination of wishful thinking, poor chemical insight and limited understanding of the techniques involved # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is an outline of a paper, and not a fully-thought, well-organized, thoroughly-discussed paper. Maybe because it's a graduate student conference the author decided not to put any time into writing a quality paper that would be accepted in an academic journal. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I found every single reading of every theorist mentioned in this article seriously wanting. I will highlight the three most egregious because this review is already getting quite long. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
this piece shows no real understanding of history at all # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The final section illustrates the paper's poverty. Instead of a summary of the intellectual issues addressed, we are given a series of bland recommendations, the sort of banality that civil servants write for their masters' speeches. It has no place in a serious academic journal. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a pointless paper. It offers neither interesting new data nor cogent explanation # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Data is presented as though it were reliable observation when it could equally well be described as unwarranted slander # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The introduction seems pointless. It offers some odd views # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Your piece is very well written and researched. I think the is interesting, but not particularly useful. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I do not believe or trust the data presented or the underlying thesis. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
That run-on, one sentence paragraph is perhaps the most egregious example of how the author needs to take more time and slow down structure at the grammatical level. More importantly, the author needs to slow down the process of research, reflection, and logical argumentation. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
this is where the real problems start # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The stimulus is artificially produced and therefore irrelevant. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There are many stylistics phrases to tidy which you can find yourself # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In the course of this paper many stones were thrown but, unfortunately, no birds were harmed. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The concluding 'takes a village' sentence is also a bit unoriginal. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper is conceptually unclear, and the causal argument/hypotheses are muddled. In short, it is a mess. I stopped reading after page 7. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There is a lot of terminology flung around here that is insufficiently explained. What exactly is meant, for example, by "false negative" and "false positive" rates? "median, first quartile, and third quartile"? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This interesting effort reminds one of the biblical tale of trying to extract water from a stone in the desert; from this metaphor, you may gather that we conclude that the effort did not yield useful data. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Have you no command of the English language? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
You make the reader feel uneducated # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Since this is a model formulation paper, there does not need to be a Results section, but if there were, the paper would be easier to follow. There really is no formulation of a model # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Although this study, an original work and repetition of earlier feature of these studies is similar. Writing language is quite a lot of grammatical errors # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
You haven't read all relevant studies. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The main problem is that it does not fit the intuition about what should work. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In the end, even after writing a summary of the argument, I am not sure what is the thesis of the essay (or whether there is one) or how and why its parts are connected if I disregard any private knowledge of the topic # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Unfortunately the manuscript is not well structured and the English is very poor. Usually I would attempt to improve this, but in this case the entire manuscript needs to be reworked – starting with the tittle. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a misleading paper, badly executed and negligently written. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a terrible sentence. It has so many different things in it and not enough punctuation. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This part is a little repetitive from what you said earlier. I can see that there are some variation, but it feels repetitive when reading it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I'm sorry, but I'm reading this thinking, we've already heard about that, you're telling us again and now you're telling me I'm going to hear about it again in the next chapter. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There is no research methodology, no data, no model, no significant analysis and no conclusions which arise from the study # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The description of sampling technique is too long and boring! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Nothing new or ground breaking is discussed in this tutorial # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is clear that this manuscript will not win a beauty contest. There are still many awkward sentences that make me feel like listening to someone that scratches a glass plate with an iron nail # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors must know the difference between scientific research and 'news clip' for the Sunday newspaper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This information is utterly useless and would not worth any publication at all. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
A proof reading by a mother tongue would improve readability. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
These theoretical results have not been verified experimentally. Therefore, they are wrong # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
When the author -and I'll refer to you as the author despite the effort you have put into ensuring that I know who you are - writes that there has been no new models in this area for 20 years, lack of relevance is the reason. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper has about the same relevance as a paper in astronomy which places the earth as the centre of the university - while it can be made to look plausible, the basic premises is WRONG. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
They did a few sloppy experiments and attached his name to the great pioneering work by Prof. Bob. He should not be mentioned. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I still find this to be a very difficult paper to read, with many possible alternate explanations. But it would take me a long time to try and figure this out, so I am approving publication. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Considering by the end of the paper I had no idea what was being said, I don't believe the paper was successful in its argument. In fact, it felt like the author was merely saying the same thing over and over again but with synonyms. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Although there are obvious differences in male/female ratios between patients and controls, the failure to find differences between males and females may be a type II error # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I was somewhat disappointed after reading the MS; I was initially expecting some lighting hit but nothing really happened in the end. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I could not find any passage in the MS that would explain to me what is the exact novel idea, proposal, argument or hypothesis # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The proposed research requires a set of knowledge related to a*, b*, c, d, e*, f*, g*, h* and i*. The candidate has not demonstrated to me the required knowledge in any of the starred areas. Even in the other areas I am not sure that her knowledge will be deep enough. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper is overlong, very verbose and contains unnecessary repetition. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The interchangeably use of evaluate and validate is a concern because it is not clear if authors know the difference between these two 'verbs' # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Pleasepleaseplease with sugar on top remove sentences that sound like Hegelian light bulb moments while not meaning anything in the context of your empirical study. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Nothing changes in our collective research programs as a result of this work. Still, the work is well done and needs to appear somewhere in the literature. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper contains neither theory nor research. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This proposal left me cold # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Concerning the discussion, again the merits of the work are downplayed to a point that it's almost pathetic! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The accompanying simulation movie is neither interesting, nor particularly beautiful. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Presented paper has 13 pages and 26 adequate references. The paper seems to be very interesting. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I would suggest that you do some homework and redirect this work to an actual new and novel and mechanistic work and test it against real world data # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
proposal language is frightfully unclear. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I stopped reading here. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I recommend the authors drop these assertions and predictions. The motivation for the present work, then, becomes an effort to characterise the effects. Unfortunately, this revised scope is more limited. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I found the paper a challenge to evaluate, expecting some profound methodological or theoretical insight. Yet none appeared to be forthcoming. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Your footnote is unnecessary, and indeed confusing. Where did you get the word "oftentimes" from? We are in the 21st century now. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It would be charitable to call this a comparison of apples and oranges. It's more like steak and bicycle. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I counted 15 uses of 'clear' or 'clearly.' That's one per page. 'Clearly' the results aren't as clear as the author would like them to be. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
So, in summary: the paper is oblique to the entire current literature, it fails to relate such investigations as it reports to the current literatures of the questions to which it claims to be relevant, and it actually acknowledges (in its own last sentence) that the history of the field has simply passed it by. It is as if the grant that it acknowledges for support was awarded in 1990 instead of, oh, 2010 or so. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
They arbitrarily rule out models with interactions but without corresponding main effects. Etc. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In the interest of being helpful, my suggestion is that the authors go back and review what is involved in the scientific method. An essential step in the scientific method is posing hypotheses and/or asking questions, and that step is completely lacking in this study. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Looking at the general poor quality of the paper, I'm surprised by the list of the co-authors # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This code sample cannot be adequately described without the use of strong language. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The author is tilting at windmills. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors presents a flurry of statistics, but they do not explain why or how those are relevant to the study. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
A good deal of effort has been expended here, but to what end? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I have three main objections to this paper: it is self-contradictory, it is functionally obsolete, and it has been submitted to the wrong kind of journal. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
the conclusions of this paper are then groundless since they are based on this trivial but critical misunderstanding. Unfortunately, it has to be remarked that papers such as this, lacking any knowledge of the basic concepts of astronomy and physics, should never be published in any scientific journal with referees. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Among the topics to be subject to the integrity of attention needs to be work related to the subject of innovation does not. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The main inconvenience of the paper is that the conclusions are not supported by the experimental results. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The use of the word "surgeries" to mean "surgical procedures" instead of a surgeon's office is a linguistic atrocity of a magnitude similar to "irregardless" or "I could care less # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper is ill-informed and poorly argued. It is not suitable in my view for this or any other journal. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper does not contain information that could make a scientific proposal. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
We note that you may well have completed an interesting study with an appropriate research design and methods but the manuscript in its current form does not convey that. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am sympathetic to what the author is trying to do here # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is not clear what the author wants to accomplish. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This whole paper is wildly speculative and needlessly convoluted. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
revise this paper at your own risk # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It was hard to bite myself through, but in the back I found some meat. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors merely used somewhat bigger guns than previous studies and generated nothing but more smoke. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
it is not clear whether important new insights will be gleaned - it cannot be clear until the final product of his research is reviewed. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Perhaps my greatest criticism of the paper is the tendency of the authors to make an argument and then to almost immediately contradict themselves repeatedly. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
First, unless my statistics is failing me, a less than 1.0 SD is not significant. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The text is at several places marred by conceptual messiness, careless reasoning, sloppy phrasing and inadequate acquaintance with the relevant literature # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In addition, your figures are provided at 72 dpi, which is fine for children's games, but professional quality images require 300 dpi. Also, the images should be cropped to the actual image area (not embedded in a sea of white space). # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
SURELY THE AUTHORS CAN COME UP WITH A BETTER REFERENCE THAN WIKIPEDIA TO SUPPORT THEIR POINT HERE! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors do not control for the height of their subjects in their experiment. What they call prejudice against women may be argued to be prejudice against shorter people # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Using the question in the first paragraph of the introduction is not functional in my opinion, as are the words 'inner workings'. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The regression analysis is rubbish. Let's see what happens when you do this properly. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Neither research nor science # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
English need to be corrected by an English speaker # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
(although I admit that here is a possibility they might turn out to be correct in that they are guessing right) # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The whole piece presents a non-argument. It simply confirms something self-evident and dresses it up as remarkable by building up a straw man that is duly demolished. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Poorly connected and thinly reported anecdotes are reported as though they represent detailed and searching ethnography, and then jargon-riddled assertions are made as though the meagre data substantiate the claims. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Are you kidding? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am concerned that the author is not getting the advice that she needs in order to produce a publishable paper, and I hope that my comments are read in the spirit in which they are intended; that is, constructive criticism to produce a better final product. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Overall, this paper goes to significant amounts of trouble to accomplish something that is already well established as a technique in a less elegant manner than is currently employed. This paper should not be published. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is difficult to see the merits of this proposal, and it is doubtful whether the author has the necessary command of primary and secondary sources to contribute anything to this area of research # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Unfortunately the paper itself is full of so many fundamental misunderstandings, I don't even know where to begin in criticizing it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
However the paper has several fundamental flaws that give it little or no value as a thoughtful piece of research or reflection contributing new knowledge, perspectives or suggesting solutions to an important area of human endeavor. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Although no ground-shaking breakthroughs are made, it is worthy of publication # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Clearly you can tell that I have become distracted by the style of reporting results. I have in fact given up trying to find the real biological trends in the results. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I invite the authors to provide compelling, coherent, and quantitative data. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I think the N-mixture modeling should be abandoned: it is clear that the authors do not understand this class of models # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The abstract proposes the identification of requirements of a future digital infrastructure based on intelligent transportation systems (whatever this is). However, this aim is not fulfilled by the paper' # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This inclusion criteria is not needed due to the fact to be in a master program they would be legal adults. Please remove and adjust anywhere that this shows up. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper is so bad, it would take an entire 20 page paper to describe all the problems it has. And even after that I'm not sure it would be worth publishing. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
However, in my view the research question being asked is not very clear, the treatment of the dataset is not very thorough, and the conclusions are rather trivial or even self-contradictory. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
DO NOT have your heroes set the villain on FIRE. It's actually considered a war crime, and it is a very gruesome experience leaving horrific scars and affecting health for the rest of your life. It tends to make the heroes look like major arses. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This sounds nice, but in fact it is vague. There are many instances of this kind of nice-sounding vagueness. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is not even wrong # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The manuscript can be much kinder to those who are unfamiliarwith, or not interested in, the issue. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The opinion expressed in the MS is highly biased and patriotically motivated, and is not suitable for publication in this journal. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
My argument against it as a full paper is that it makes an incremental contribution to the state of the science. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Even though the objective of the paper pretends to be ambitious, there are a significant number of problems that limit the study's usefulness. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Although this is a well written paper, it reminded me more of an essay that someone might write for a lit theory class rather than a generative scientific review. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am pretty sure that there are a number of mistakes, but I gave up pointing out them all because even the author apparently doesn't consider this manuscript as a good scientific presentation. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper is extremely lengthy and tedious with respect to its importance and relevance. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I believe that there are important questions in this area, questions that have intellectual merit, but the PI has not found any to study here # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This piece offers nothing new, is poorly written, analytically weak and repeatedly inaccurate. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper brings to mind the Mark Twain quote: 'I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.' # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper is grossly over referenced, and reads a little like a student trying to impress a supervisor that a lot has been read, rather than a mature and parsimonious use of citations. The conclusions are hardly world shattering. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The manuscript's tone is occasionally too casual, a bit too winking in a David-Foster-Wallace-ish kind of way. This is unfortunately borne out all too clearly in the author's self-presentation on his website, whose home page is inappropriate if not offensive as a professional introduction. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Based on these my recommendation would be that the present manuscript cannot be published in this or any other journal. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Startlingly naive and jejune. Obviously a poorly tailored master's thesis. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
A blizzard of extraneous data external information should be culled. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This last version is riddled with redundant information and circular phrases. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper is blithely silent on the kinds of issues that occupy yards of library shelf-space, and goes well beyond what is warranted by the data. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper is definitely not suitable to PNAS, or, for that matter to any other journal. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Firstly, the framing of the research question is entirely flawed # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This article reads like the work of a reasonably competent undergraduate. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I certainly agree with your point here but please do not justify it with all the selectivley chosen and largely incorrect arguments above # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a rather pedestrian treatment of a popular and well-reported topic # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Too mathematically inclined. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Despite my negative overall rating I encourage the authors to continue their research in this area but also suggest reading How to Design and Report Experiments by Field and Hole beforehand. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is rubbish!!! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Once I penetrated the pigeon English, I found very little substance underneath. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The author has re-invented lukewarm water. This is all naive philologising. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am not very excited about this. There must be better ways to spend your money. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Some idea of strategies to define general populations for studies might be helpful both to the reader and to help the authors avoid their meaningless generalities. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I do not trust the data or the underlying thesis. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper still reads in places more like alternative fan-fiction than scholarship. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There may be a good paper crying to be let out of this manuscript but if so, it is hard to know. The language, not to mention the overuse of symbols, is so dense that one quickly loses track of what was actually measured, what was invented or assumed, and what is being discussed. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
While it is true that the authors are under no "legal" obligation to cite these results, as they are unpublished, they are probably morally obliged to consider what they tell us in comparison with their own results. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It was agonizing for this reviewer to read a total of nine pages describing the overall methods. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Come on please!!! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Why don't you just send copies of this to the two people in the world who care about it, and forget the publication route? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a heretofore unobserved result and is very interesting, but is not novel. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
My comments indicate, primarily, a concern that you understand the nature of this case study design and the proper role of your case-specific theoretical argumentation, on the one hand, and the case-specific research data, on the other. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
As I understand it, you already have good evidence (you've said as much on Facebook). There's no reason to leave this as an open question when you know the answer. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a nicely done paper but the sample is small, the measures uninformative, and the findings have only very weak relevance to policy or practice. Nothing much one can do about these flaws. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I stopped reading the subsequent data reports carefully, because I no longer had confidence that they would be accurate. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The project is lack of interest. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Table 2 stunningly over-interprets some relatively small signals in the data. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I think this article is carefully argued, but at no moment is it stated that Heidegger was a Nazi. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
A classic instance of reinvention of the square wheel. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
It is shocking to read how statistics are being misused just for the sake of being able to write something. I rate this article as very un-scientific. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The conclusion is something of a shaggy dog. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The derivation is correct but too simple! The paper is therefore not suitable for a general readership. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Not earth shatteringly original but it is hard to be so in this field. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
If philosophy of science was not taught in the author's doctoral program, he needs to go back and dope slap his major professor. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper represents an example of a piece of work that just crosses the threshold into the category of "least publishable unit". # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The theoretical section is just about unreadable for anyone unfamiliar with the language of the relevant French theorists. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
For a section on thought, very little seems to have gone into it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Those talks are popular, but then so are Ke$ha concerts # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The biggest problem with this manuscript, which has nearly sucked the will to live out of me, is the terrible writing style. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The presentation is of a standard that I would reject from an undergraduate student # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Alarming errors, even if they could be easily corrected, gave the manuscript a sense of carelessness that makes me hesitant to recommend it for revisions. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper is so devoid of content it should be rejected outright. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There is a sense that there is a finding, but not much of an explanation for why this finding makes sense, and why it is interesting and important. The introduction is particularly weak. It begins with some general statements which have nothing to do with the current research, and then describes each variable separately in an order that makes no apparent sense. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There are a number of awkward sentences (these occur as early as the abstract), and the writer has a tendency to overburden the sentence. At a deeper level, the argument is at times uninspiring. Nevertheless, the topic is interesting enough. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The organization and writing of the paper need to improve. There are some grammar errors need to correct. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The title of the submission is misleading and it should be renamed "A Personal Diary". # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper is neither exciting nor harmful. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Are we modeling an astronomical object here or an abstraction? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Putting it unfairly perhaps, and I am sure this is not what is meant, but one ungenerous reading of the proposal is. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This would have been a question of high interest 10 years back # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
On my opinion, the approach the authors are using is trivial and the problem they are solving is made up. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors should at least try to read some of the previous work in the field before attempting to solve our problems. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The conclusions are still not consistent with the (lack of) findings. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Theories can be meaningful when they can explain phenomenon. If theories exist for themselves, they may be play of language. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
A weak paper, poor experimental design, comparison of sequences using different primers, no statistical analysis possible, carelessly written, poorly thought through. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The first and last paragraphs are weak and read in a style unlike the rest of the paper, like poor advertising copy. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Very very sloppy. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors have entered a controversial area. For both their sake and the reputation of the journal, they need to make sure their research will stand up under the inevitable scrutiny. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The best thing about the paper in its current form is that it is short, so I did not waste a lot of time reading it; it looks like someone's smart graduate student has been foraging in theory and has managed to learn how to mangle simple concepts and hide them behind pretentious but empty prose. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Good topic, but I don't get an idea of the results. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Unless and until more appropriate methods are employed, it is impossible to judge the claims of the authors although, based on previous results, there is real reason to believe that the claims may pan out in some generic sense. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I also would add that while I don't have anything serious to complain about, I also see this work as being pretty straightforward - there is no "big idea" that I see as especially imaginative or creative. Again, it is extremely solid, just not necessarily sexy. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I now have had a chance to look at this paper. I think it is a bit of a joke. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is from a methods perspective rather unacceptable in these days of 'voodoo' science. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
If this topic were not dear to my heart, I would perhaps have struggled to follow your logic. I applaud the effort, and I find the data reviews relatively interesting and useful. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
There are FAR too many analyses and results. The reader is swamped. It's simply not possible to take it all in. It needs to be pruned. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This technique will never work. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This needs to be standardized!!! It must be converted into population density, e.g. inhabitants per km2!!! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Why should we expect some kind of relationship with these variables?? It needs to be justified in the introduction!!! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Mr. Beard is very courageous when he gives freely so many references to other books, because if a student ever did look at another book, I am sure he would not return again to continue reading Mr. Beard. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Like Dr Who's Tardis, the inside of the paper is bigger than the outside. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The odds ratios in Table 2 are like the plains of Kansas: flat, flat flat! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Perhaps I have just read these papers at monthly intervals and the author had bad luck. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The rest of this review operates from the assumption that this paper is a sincere attempt at scientific evidence and argument. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I also do not feel that the lead PI is qualified to undertake this work, or more accurately, that she should undertake this work; she needs to be academically successful first. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The research adds meaningful to the literature, how? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Was this an undergraduate class assignment? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Preliminary and intriguing results that should be published elsewhere. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
So, what is the point of this? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The statistical analyses were not correct. Actually they were so confused that I lost all confidence in the analyses and data presentation. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This kind of prose simply borders on cruelty against the reader. And finally comes the conclusion, which is the intellectual equivalent of bubblegum. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I suppose that I should be happy that I don't have to spend a lot of time reviewing this dreadful paper; however I am depressed that people are performing such bad science. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Other papers are cited that were clearly not read carefully, resulting in some memorable howlers. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This needs some rephrasing—it's loaded with the assumption that there is a real world. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The problem is epitomized by almost every word choice in the title # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Words are used inappropriately—I count, for example, 13 instances of "unique", but it is used correctly only once. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors showed the differences at scale 3, and so what? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Please use something in parenthesis so your reader doesn't have to take a break from reviewing your work to Google it # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The introduction is so confusing and purely written that I gave up. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
And finally, the references are a mess. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The findings are not novel and the solution induces despair. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I would suggest the authors to have some native English speaking to go through it # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This would be a stronger article if its tone were less polemical and more analytical. The following paragraph, for example, will strike many of your readers as shrill. They will stop reading the article and throw it into the fire # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
What do the authors mean by one standard error? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I can see that the manuscript has archival value # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is such a promising topic, but I was very disappointed in this paper combining a substantial amount of author talent. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am generally very happy to provide extensive suggestions and comments on manuscripts, but this submission was an absolute waste of my time. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I understand that Wikipedia is not the best source for my information, however, I don't have access to the peer-reviewed literature you cite, and based on the information from Wikipedia, your hypothesis breaks down. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
To me the question is uninteresting # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The authors offer no credible theoretical reason why we should care about this result. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Not sure how to say this diplomatically, but the manuscript is really dull # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
All these data are given in the author's Ph.D thesis. Does this material need to be published? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
From this conclusion, the premise does not follow. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The history of science tells us that a strong theory that explains numerous phenomena is generally overturned by a better theory, rather than by the wholly negative and nitpicking criticisms of the present paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Who are and where did they come from? That is, why was this obscure and arbitrary method chosen? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Nobody in their right mind would ever suggest such a model # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This review is without a doubt the single most difficult one I have had to write so far. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Reject – More holes than my grandad's string vest! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
That omission is a standard feature of articles from the fourth author's lab. Although it normally does not bite him, it does in this case. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper is under-referenced, conceptually impoverished, and poorly written # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This work amounts to a form of methodological perfectionism. Perfectionism can be the enemy of the possible in science. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The last two sentences of the summary greatly exaggerate the value of this paper and the usefulness of its conclusions. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The research claims these phenomena are "understudied," as though there is some amount of study they should endure. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The most striking—and troubling—feature of this manuscript is that it contains so many exceedingly strange assumptions. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I'm disappointed to say, given the outstanding pedigree of the authors of this paper, that it adds nothing to earlier research. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The abstract says absolutely nothing, and I mean this literally and not as a judgment for the content of the paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am afraid this manuscript may contribute not so much towards the field's advancement as much as towards its eventual demise. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This ridiculous comment that a powerful computer algebra systems was required on page 6 is absurd. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I hope the authors can learn from this exercise on what is expected to craft a publishable paper. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This looks like a very early draft # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The paper is okay, its not "wow" but its hard to reject it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
They claim on page 9 a significant improvement of their method. This is stupid! # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The figures are dishonest and not all that useful. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Studies undertaken in such a manner as presented here degrade all science by giving the semblance of legitimacy to illegitimate work. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
As far as this reviewer can tell, what the authors present is not so much a model as it is an equation. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The present article, however, is in no way impressive, as its stands out by sloppiness in conceptual, theoretical as well as methodological aspects and does barely add any relevant knowledge. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The stimuli are impossible to compute. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I know you want to use hormones to study physiological changes, but humans are more than hormones. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I was not sure exactly which problem the author is trying to solve and vice verse it was not clear to me what problem the solution is intended to solve or explorer. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
To justify these conclusions and spur the authors onto the better things they are undoubtedly capable of I append some details. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a perfect example of the worst kind of research in social psychology. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
presumptuous, ignorant and downright dangerous. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I am constructing this review more in a stream of conscious thought than a systematic assessment. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
That gives a ridiculous demonstration where authors forgot science and reinvent history. The authors don't have a clue of what was already done in the literature. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I have to reject this paper. It is saying a triviality hidden behind some math and I am not sure if the authors are even aware of this fact. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
In fact, your hypotheses are not all that complex are they? Nor is Figure 1; n'est-ce pas? # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The underlying agenda is a sales pitch. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Proposition 7 was so fundamentally wrong that I saw no point in reading beyond it. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
If the paper is accepted, I strongly recommend an English proof-reading. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The enormous and overwhelming -not to say pathetic- admiration, even adoration of the author for her subject is barely acceptable anymore for a modern biography. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
Unfortunately, the paper is very shallow. The results are at the level of a naive master thesis. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
I doubt that it's worth publishing a handful of graphs that few would find surprising and that anyone else could generate in a day off. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
To put it bluntly: The last thing I want is a reviewer rejecting my papers with reference to an ideological paper like this one. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
The examples are stale – the method is not exciting. There is nothing much here. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This paper adds nothing to the existing knowledge of the subject. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This, of course, is disingenuous if not unethical. # <https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/>
This is a bizarre paper. # <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MC.2005.423>
This paper is incorrect and most of its conclusions are false. # <http://www.ams.org/notices/199703/comm-mr.pdf>
The results are presented by means of a terminology and in a style of which it is impossible here to give the slightest idea; the notions introduced by the author ('radiors', 'coradiors', 'expansors') appear to be totally superfluous (unless it is to rescue his work from complete indiscretion) and can be cast in relatively civilized language. Nevertheless it would be premature and imprudent to attach to these comments any absolute value because of the uncertainty which weighs on the intentions of the author. # <http://www.ams.org/notices/199703/comm-mr.pdf>
The reviewer is unable to follow these proofs which hinge on unexplained dependencies among the ten variables introduced.
The author offered to explain the 'proof' of the Fermat conjecture to the reviewer. The reviewer declined, considering such a meeting pointless, because - as transpires from the book - the author has difficulties with the language of mathematics. # <http://www.ams.org/notices/199703/comm-mr.pdf>
This application for a postdoctoral fellowship has few strengths other than the applicant’s dogged and stubborn effort to do studies he conceptualized much earlier in his career and for which he has struggled to find a home. ... As a result, the training plan is very weak. His letters of recommendation contain, at best, faint praise and mainly focus on his stubborn determination to pursue his long-term goal. # <https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/2dh5al/labrats_what_is_the_meanestharshest_reviewer/cjpylef/>
But from a scientific point of view, its method and argument is really ridiculous. # <https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/151477>
The authors do not show an adequate statistical literacy. They misused statistical tools on insufficient data and misinterpreted the result, leading to premature claims that only bring media popularity but harm academic reputation. It is a pity that a field at such an early stage already gets plagued by statistical fallacies.The cherry-picking of search keywords for internet trends is a very questionable research practice [21]. We understand that digital epidemiology suffers from insufficient data, as the authors admit in the manuscript. This does not justify the abuse of statistical methods and the suppression of evidence. In the case of insufficient evidence, the only right thing is to refrain from making any claim and simply stop writing a paper. # <https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/151521>
Disappointingly, this project proposal didn't fulfill the requirements stated in the call.

Back in 2004, I wrote an early blog entry that seems to have greatly upset him, by describing (accurately I still think) a popular article on the landscape he wrote with Raphael Bousso for a Scientific American issue about Einstein and his legacy as pseudo-science that would have made Einstein gag. # <https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=12910>
The latest issue of Scientific American is devoted to articles about Einstein and his legacy. One article in the magazine doesn’t really have much to do with Einstein and I believe would make him gag if he were still around. The article, entitled "The String Theory Landscape" is by Raphael Bousso and Joe Polchinski. In it they claim credit for the pseudo-scientific idea of "explaining" the value of the cosmological constant by the existence of the "landscape" and the anthropic principle. It’s sad to see this nonsense being purveyed by the most respected and well-known popular science publication in the US. For something more sensible about the anthropic principle, see a recent column from Nature. # <https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=73>
It's pretty much the usual hype about the string theory and the multiverse, with untestable ideas about quantum gravity the only topic. # <https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=8149>
My problem with a lot of the West Coast theorists is that I don't seem to have the same sense of humor, so often I have trouble telling when they're joking (does anyone know when Andrei Linde is joking?). Here though it seems quite clear that Polchinski is pulling the leg of the philosophers gathered to hear him speak. My calculations show that the chance the above text could be a serious contribution to a philosophy of science conference cannot be above .1%. # <https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=8149>
I'm curious to hear from people at the conference what gets the bigger laughs: this or Kane's argument that the unknown theory predicts a 1.5 TeV gluino (unless it’s not found, in which case it doesn't). # <https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=8149>
Should we cite the crappy Gabor paper here? # <https://retractionwatch.com/2014/11/11/overly-honest-references-should-we-cite-the-crappy-gabor-paper-here/>
Basically those who talk about correlation stocks-bonds (while  smoking you with details) have the reasoning abilities & clarity of mind of overactive circus monkeys accidentally given steroids. # <https://nitter.net/nntaleb/status/1543956438078431232#m>
llipticality is a condition more necessary than thin tails, recall my Twitter fight with that non-probabilist Clifford Asness where I questioned not just his empirical claims and his real-life record, but his own theoretical rigor and the use by that idiot Antti Ilmanen of cartoon models to prove a point about tail hedging. Their entire business reposes on that ghost model of correlation-diversification from modern portfolio theory. # <https://fooledbyrandomness.com/blog/index.php/2021/11/24/detecting-bs-in-correlation-windows/>
The Lancet article: Maron, Barry J., and Paul D. Thompson. “Longevity in elite athletes: the first 4-min milers.” The Lancet 392, no. 10151 (2018): 913 contains an eggregious probabilistic mistake in handling “expectancy” a severely misunderstood –albeit basic– mathematical operator. It is the same mistake you read in the journalistic “evidence based” literature about ancient people having short lives (discussed in Fooled by Randomness), that they had a life expectancy (LE) of 40 years in the past and that we moderns are so much better thanks to cholesterol lowering pills. # <https://fooledbyrandomness.com/blog/index.php/2021/01/09/some-misunderstanding-of-life-expectancy-with-some-good-news/>
Yeah yeah yeah, Notepad++ is OK, but honestly I am sick of it. You are not getting any praise from me. Sorry dude. I have used it for years and still can't figure out your ridiculous settings for User Defined Languages, Styles, Global Overrides and all the rest. It is complete BS. All I want is a greenish background, black text and when I want to select some text, I want to be able to see it is highlighted, in the highlighting method I want. I do NOT understand why the entire line goes to a white background when I move the cursor around. It makes no sense. I have had it and will move on from trying to understand your thinking. You have made what used to be a good editor into a massive piece of garbage. Maybe you should look at Google's search screen and think that for a while (coming from someone who despises Google). WTF is a "global override" anyway... And all those "folding" styles... and "tokens"? LOL # <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/v843-unhappy-users-edition/>
