# bmtreport diction files

- DONE: Make *warning* diction file to identify things which are not necessarily wrong but could indicate that something is wrong. Run this less frequently; bmt.diction is intended to identify likely errors, not simply possible errors.

- TODO: Pinker talk: minimize hedging: somewhat, fairly, nearly, seemingly, in part, relatively, comparatively, predominantly, to some extent, so to speak, presumably, virtually, literally. Not sure I agree with him. I think hedging is honest.
- Relative terminology: about, superior, similar, comparable, essentially, type, of the order of, substantially, substantial portion, the order of about
- Exemplary language: e.g. "material such as rock wool or asbestos", "halogen, for example, chlorine" (It is the broader example or the specific example? I would read it as broader. This seems to be more of a problem for claims than writing in general.) (I also recall that "i.e." and "e.g." are misunderstood in general so should be discouraged in favor of "that is" and "for example" respectively.)
- MPEP 2173.05 has many good suggestions about how to write unambiguously (and also some that are specific to patents or particular parts of patents)

## TODO: patents

Make patent drafting diction database. Put appropriate case law in the comment. Label as "patent profanity" as that term seems to be in common use. If unclear about why someone included a particular term, ask on the Patents Stack Exchange.

- Google search for "patent profanity" (no quotes).
- Include relative phrases.
