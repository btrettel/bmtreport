>  such packages largely neglect the relations between statements and leave them to be figured out from the presentation by a human reader; even Leslie Lamportâ€™s proposal in [Lam94a] failed to catch on in mathematics. Two notable exceptions are the MMiSSLaTeX [DLL+04] and Salt [GHMD07] approaches, which allow to annotate LATEX documents with ontological relations to interrelate scientific documents and identify claims in them for search purposes. The MathLang format [KMW07] goes still a little farther, extending the semantic relations to the sub-sentence level, but is only implemented in the TeXmacs editor, not directly in LATEX.
